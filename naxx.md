# Prepping for Naxx

Naxxramas is a much more expensive raid to run than what we’ve done thus far. There is a literal cost to attunement. Many valuable materials are needed for frost resistance armor. Even more for a complete Tier 3 armor set. As well as higher repair bills and more demand for consumables.

[Naxx Armor Cost Estimator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1si6sUHfb4LqRwsBzyB9Fal9RkO3F4BozdNM04xZVSdg/edit?usp=sharing)

This guide is to help you prepare for Naxx by starting to collect materials now. Giving you time to save up what you need. Avoiding the sticker shock of prices when Phase 6 is announced and released.

As well as the materials listed below you should also work on saving up more gold and consumables. Naxx has twice as many bosses as Molten Core or Blackwing Lair. With more wipes expected until we can get it on farm status. Even dying before reaching the raid entrance is possible. Repair costs will be higher for everyone. The more challenging fights will also mean more consumables.

Guide Notes:

*   Phase 6 and Naxxramas are expected to be released mid January 2021.
*   Frozen Runes, used by frost resistance armor, are found inside Naxxramas. They will be collected and distributed by the guild.
*   Glacial Cloaks with an enchant will be provided to all Naxx raiders by the guild. If you have the means to get mats for your own that's helpful, but not required.
*   Tier 3 pieces require various "wartorn" items, which drop from trash in Naxx. These will be collected and distributed by the guild.
*   You may not want all eight Tier 3 pieces, depending on your BiS and set bonus. Kel'Thuzad drops class rings which are the 9th piece of everyone’s Tier 3 armor. It counts toward your set bonus. Adjust your personal shopping list to match.
*   We don’t know how much time we’ll have in Naxx. In vanilla TBC released 6 months later. There may not be enough time for everyone to get their full set.
*   Naxx gear lasted for many levels during the early part of TBC.

## Naxxramas Attunement

Attunement for Naxxramas is a simple quest. You must be honored with Argent Dawn to start. You will need to turn in various materials, depending on your AD rep.

**Honored**

*   60 gold
*   Arcane Crystal x5
*   Nexus Crystal x2
*   Righteous Orb x1

**Revered**

*   30 gold
*   Arcane Crystal x2
*   Nexus Crystal x1

**Exalted**

*   Free

****

## Gaining Argent Dawn Reputation

As you can see, earning AD rep now can save gold for attunement late. Reaching exalted may not be workable for everyone. But revered is doable, being only half the effort as Exalted.

**Kill Undead**

*   Regular mobs - Give rep until 3000/6000 into Friendly.
*   Elite mobs - Give rep until 11999/12000 into Honored.
*   Strat/Scholo trash mobs - Give rep until 11999/12000 into Honored
*   Strat/Scholo bosses - Give rep through exalted

**Complete Western & Eastern Plagueland Quests**

*   In case you skipped them while leveling up, go back and complete all the quests you can find in the Plaguelands.
*   As well as any dealing with Stratholme or Scholomance.

**Scourgestones**

*   Drop from undead in Plaguelands, Strat, and Scholo.
*   Turn in for rep and a valor token, which can provide extra rep.
*   It is recommended to save these until revered if going for exalted.
*   Keep at least 15 valor tokens for shoulder enchant quest. Valor tokens will also have increased value come Phase 6.

## Frost Resistance Gear

All raiders will be required to meet a 200 frost resistance (unbuffed) minimum for the [Sapphiron](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=15989/sapphiron) fight in Naxxramas. These can be met with two quests found within Naxx, a few crafted pieces, and a couple of extras.

The guild will provide all raiders with a [Glacial Cloak](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22658/glacial-cloak) and [Greater Resistance](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20014/enchant-cloak-greater-resistance) enchant. If you have the means you can provide your own cloak mats, helping out everyone else.

*   Bolt of Runecloth x4 (Runecloth x20)
*   Ironweb Spider Silk x4
*   Essence of Water x2

See [Frost Resistance Gear for Naxx](https://queuebitt.github.io/frost-resist) for a more detailed breakdown of pieces and materials.

## Crafter Reputation

The crafted frost resistance gear is tied to [Argent Dawn](https://classic.wowhead.com/faction=529/argent-dawn) and [Hydraxian Waterlords](https://classic.wowhead.com/faction=749/hydraxian-waterlords) rep.

*   Blacksmith - Exalted with Argent Dawn, Revered with Hydraxian Waterlords
*   Leatherworker - Exalted with Argent Dawn, Revered with Hydraxian Waterlords
*   Tailor - Revered with Argent Dawn, Revered with Hydraxian Waterlords

Guild officers will make sure there is at least one of each crafter with the necessary rep. If you’d like to assist please work toward the reputation levels above.

Players exalted with AD can get an NPC to craft the gear for you. But besides needing the same materials they will also charge you hundreds of gold. Save your money and use a guild crafter.

*****

## Tier 3 Armor

Each class has a Tier 3 armor set available from Naxxramas. They are token base, but each piece also requires the completition of a quest. Which asks for a significant amount of crafting materials. The total value of which for a full set is high.

You can start gathering most of the materials needed now. Given the total sum this will save you gold and stress in the long run.

## Using Your Profession's Cooldowns

All classes can benefit from the cooldowns available to certain professions.

Tailoring creates Mooncloth every 4 days

*   Mage
*   Priest
*   Warlock

Leatherworking creates Refined Deeprock Salt/Cured Rugged Hide every 3 days

*   Druid
*   Hunter
*   Rogue

Alchemy creates Arcanite Bars every 2 days

*   Hunter
*   Paladin
*   Warrior

Rogues making their own Cured Rugged Hide will need to start within 10 days of Phase 5 arriving. Other classes can start using professional cooldowns later and have enough time. But the sooner you start the more extra material you'll have. That can be used to trade with guildmates for other materials you need. Or sell on the AH so you can buy what you need.

*****

## Professions On Alts

If you have a level 35+ alt they can be used for profession cooldowns. To skill them up quickly you'll need to buy materials. That and training will cost you gold up front. But the cost savings will break even within two months. And you can create a profit after that.

[WoW Classic Professions Leveling Guide](https://www.wow-professions.com/classic)

If starting a new alt specifically for this I recommend a hunter or warlock. They level the fastest at lower levels.

## Earning Gold

This is a big topic, covered by many guides and videos on the Internet. You will best be served by doing some research on your own. But here are some general tips.

**Do What Works For You**

Farming, crafting, and flipping are all viable gold earning approaches. And you can find a YouTube video on any of them saying they make the most gold. Play to your strengths, not what an influencer says is best.

Farming is easy for anyone to start. Pick a spot and kill stuff. You can try for less common drops which sell on the AH. Or mobs which drop good trash (baskalisks are excellent). It does take more time and the ability to kill mobs on your own.

Crafting can make your gathering profession more profitable. Or with some startup gold you can craft using the AH for your materials. Items which raiders use regularly are your best bet. This favors alchemy and engineering over the others. Enchanting requires much more time, as you need to advertise and sell your services in cities.

Flipping can offer the highest gold to time return. But it requires good knowledge of the market you're working in. As well as start up capital and the willingness to take risks. If you're into that do your homework before you get started. And have a Plan B in mind if Naxx is fast approaching and you haven't gotten what you needed.

Everyone can run Scholomance. It is the most profitable 5-man dungeon in the game. The Dark Runes may cost less than a Righteous Orb, but they are a more common drop. And you are more likely to get a group to agree to round robin on runes than not having a PUG reserve orbs. It also grants Argent Dawn rep, which will lower your Naxx attunemnet cost.

**Find a Mentor**

If looking for specific help making money with your professions or class ask the guild for help. There are many who earn a comfortable amount of gold. And several goblins, which are players who treat gold making as a big part of the game.

Don't start with, "How do I make gold?" Instead start with "What should I selling using X profession?" Or "What are the other X class members farming for gold?" Ask specific questions and you'll get specific answers.

Understand there can be several approaches to the same goal. Take in all the answers you get, then work with what appeals to you the most. It is harder to spend time making gold if it is something you dislike.

Don't expect hand outs. And don't expect someone to give you all their secrets. But if you ask the right questions you'll get helpful answers.

**Buy Now, Sell Later**

The materials you need for Naxx will only go up in price over time. You will save gold (which is as good as earning it) by buying what you need sooner rather than later.

If you're making your own materials save what you need first. Then look at selling any surplus later. Your profits will be higher.

**Stop Leveling Alts (unless for professions)**

Whether you boost them or not, they are a drain on your total resources.

They cost you more gold than you release. At the start you buy bags, gear, and skills. Casters buy water. Then you buy them a mount. And then you can get into the more expensive gear and epic mount. At best you've broken even by level 40 with the gold the alt earns questing and doing dungeons.

Boosting alts is expensive over time. All those 5-10 gold runs add up, even with a guild discount. And boosted alts don't make any money, it all comes from your main. Stop boosting until you have enough for your raid main's needs.

More importantly, they cost you time. Whatever your means of making gold it takes time. Your raid main needs to come first. Get prepped for Naxx, then go back to your alt for fun.
