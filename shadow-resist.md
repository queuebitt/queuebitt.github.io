# Warlock Shadow Resistance Gear for AQ40

Two warlocks with lots of shadow resistance gear are for the [Twin Emperors](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=15276/emperor-veklor) fight in AQ40. Vek'lor is immune to all physical attacks. This led to the strategy of using a shadow resistant warlock as the tank. They need to have lots of health (usually a Flask of Titans) and 315 shadow resistance. As the bosses teleport locations two geared warlocks were used.

There is also a strategy for using two warriors (shouts on Vek'lor). But that also depends on heavy melee DPS being available. Having geared up warlocks gives us options for various raid compositions.
