# Rogue BiS Enchants for Phase 5

Phase 5 brings new glove and cloak enchants from AQ20 and AQ40. Including two new enchants all rogues should consider for their new AQ40 loot.

**Head**

[Death’s Embrace](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19784/deaths-embrace) - 28 attack power & 1% dodge

*   Best in slot
*   Get in on guild ZG idol runs for your best shot. Remember to buy a rogue voodoo doll from the AH, too.

[Lesser Arcanum of Voracity](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11647/lesser-arcanum-of-voracity) - 8 agility

*   Solid option if ZG enchant isn’t in the cards.
*   Libram is still pricey

**Shoulders**

[Zandalar Signet of Might](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20077/zandalar-signet-of-might) - 30 attack power

*   Best in slot
*   Requires exalted with Zandalar Tribe (ZG rep)
*   You can buy coins and bijous from AH for the tokens needed, or get some on ZG idol runs

[Nature Mantle of the Dawn](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18172/nature-mantle-of-the-dawn) - 5 nature resistance

*   Great for your nature resistance shoulders
*   Requires revered with Argent Dawn

**Cloak**

[Subtlety](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25084/enchant-cloak-subtlety) - Decreases threat by 2%

*   Best in slot
*   New in Phase 5, will need to wait for a guild enchanter to get the recipe
*   Requires new Nexus Crystals
*   Replaces the +3 agility enchant. Doesn’t directly increase DPS. But being less worried about threat does improve your DPS.

**Chest**

[Greater Stats](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20025/enchant-chest-greater-stats) - 4 all stats

*   Best in slot
*   Expensive mats and need to find an enchanter outside the guild

[Stats ](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13941/enchant-chest-stats) - 3 all stats

*   Much cheaper, and available in the guild
*   Still a DPS loss, as the better one benefits from Kings buff
