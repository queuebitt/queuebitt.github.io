# Imp Expose Armor + Shout Spam

There's a new raid meta on the scene. Imp Expose Armor + Shout Spam. We're giving it a go in Onyxia's Bakery. If all goes well it'll be a solid increase to both raid DPS and tank threat.

## Improved Expose Armor

For single boss fights we replace Sunder Armor with Expose Armor. From a rogue talented into [Improved Expose Armor](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=14169/improved-expose-armor). This provides a 5% DPS increase for all physical damage (melee and hunters). With a small DPS decrease to the talented rogue. A worth while trade.

With the normal armor reduction spells (Faerie Fire, Curse of Recklessness, Sunder Armor) a boss goes from 3731 to 336 armor. If we exchange Sunder Armor for Imp Expose Armor (the other debuffs remain) then the boss' armor drops to 36! That's more than [Annihilator](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12798/annihilator) offers. And isn't held hostage by RNG. Annihilator is still useful for removing those last 36 points. Which has more impact than it sounds, as armor has diminishing returns.

## Shout Spam

When Imp Expose Armor is applied warriors cannot use Sunder Armor. They get an error message (more powerful ability, blah blah blah). Sunder Armor is also used as a rage dump. And it provides good threat. So warrior tanks need both a new rage dump and a new threat generator. Enter [Battle Shout]( https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=27578/battle-shout).

Battle Shout has lower threat per rage (TPR) than Sunder Armor when used solo. But Battle Shout generates more threat the more targets it affects. If applied to 3 players in the warrior's group it breaks even with Sunder Armor. With 4-7 characters (hunter pets) it offers more threat and better TPR. Sunder Armor can also miss or get dodged/parried, while Battle Shout cannot.

In Phase 4 there is a small gap between Sunder Armor and Battle Shout. BS wins, provided you hit everyone in your group. In Phase 5 the gap turns into a canyon. AQ20 offers class skill books. For warriors they get a [new rank of Battle Shout]( https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21298/manual-of-battle-shout-vii). But no rank increase to Sunder Armor. The [warrior Tier 2.5]( https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=496/conquerors-battlegear) 3-piece bonus reduces the rage cost of all shouts. And we are getting a [new threat API]( https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/ptr-patch-notes-wow-classic-version-1135/553585), which will better measure threat. Addons will be able to warn the tank if their shout isn't hitting everyone in their group. So after some time in AQ20 and AQ40 our tanks will get more threat, better TPR, and be able to adjust group positions to maximize Battle Shout impact.

## Raid Changes

Apb has volunteered to be the Imp Expose Armor rogue. No other rogues need to worry about respeccing. The ideal rogue setup is [combat swords, but with 2 points in Imp Expose Armor]( https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/00502312501-3203050020050150231).

On single boss fights warriors should continue to open with Sunder Armor, getting the 5 stack up ASAP. It takes the rogue 6-9 seconds to generate the 5 combo points needed to apply Expose Armor. Once applied it is the rogue's primary responsibility to maintain Expose Armor. Loss of Expose Armor for several seconds negates all advantages and the change is a DPS loss.

Once Expose Armor is applied tanks will switch to Battle Shout. DPS can ignore Sunder Armor and use their rage elsewhere. Any tanks with remove Salvation on a Sunder Armor macro should move to a different macro.

On trash and multiple boss fights Expose Armor is not viable, due to the time needed to apply it. Warriors should use Sunder Armor as before.

Non-warrior melee DPS and hunters make no change. You should see see a 5% increase in your own DPS. Sorry, casters.

Druids will continue to apply Faerie Fire. Warlocks will continue to apply Curse of Recklessness. Annihilator may also continue to be used, but has a smaller break even point vs affecting the wielder's own DPS and threat.
