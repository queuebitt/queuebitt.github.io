# Rogue Dankmantle Armor

Phase 5 introduces Dungeon Set 2 (aka Tier 0.5). Direct upgrades to the original dungeon class armor sets. For rogues this is the [Darkmantle Armor set](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=512/darkmantle-armor). These sets do not compete with current raid gear in term of stats. So most classes will ignore them, or only go after them for fun. But the Darkmantle set has a powerful 4-piece set bonus: Chance on melee attack to restore 35 energy. This same bonus on the original Shadowcraft set made it competitive with pre-raid BiS. With Darkmantle it moved from 6-piece to 4-piece, making it viable for Phase 5 raiding.

## How Good Is Darkmantle?

Several top rogues in WoW Classic consider Darkmantle an upgrade over Phase 4 BiS. But this is theorycrafting based on sims and assumptions that the Darkmantle proc happens as frequently as the Shadowcraft proc did. Most of this testing is also done under higher parsing conditions than we experience within Onyxia's Bakery. These are rogues with full consumables, full world buffs, and optimized raid teams. They down Blackwing Lair bosses in ~90 seconds. We take 2-4 minutes. While their research is useful the conditions they set don't match what we experience. Which can change the conclusions.

Here is a good guide on Darkmantle and how it compares to Phase 4 BiS: http://classicroguecraft.com/darkmantle-p5-bis-gear-guide/

His testing shows a 12.6 DPS increase for dagger rogues moving to Darkmantle. And a 25-27 DPS increase for sword rogues. But again these are under more optimal conditions than we experience. So I ran my own numbers.

*   Bitt Model (daggers, ZG 2-piece): 2-4 DPS increase
*   Bloodfang Sword Model (epic swords, BF 8/8): Less than 1 DPS increase, potential for decrease on short fights
*   Bloodfang + ZG Sword Model (epic swords, ZG 2-piece): 20.5 DPS increase

So for me personally it is a small DPS increase, assuming good proc rates. For a sword rogue without the ZG shoulders and trinket it isn't worth while. And for a sword rogue with the ZG set (use ZG set and Darkmantle together) there's a significant DPS increase.

Finally there's the question about proc rate. Testing is being done on the PTR, and I'd be surprised if it differed from Shadowcraft. But the other concern is a rogue's time on the boss in AQ40. Some fights involve significant movement. With melee engaging and then disengaging. The Darkmantle bonus works best when you can stand your ground and keep attacking. In and out fights could easily see Darkmantle as a DPS loss, as you have lower stats, less health, and too few procs to make up the difference.

## Other Benefits of Darkmantle

Having the full Darkmantle set provides you with more options as you get new Phase 5 gear. This is mostly for rogues who want to keep up with their min/maxing before achieveing Phase 5 BiS. You can swap in different Darkmantle pieces for different gear combinations. Got your Tier 2.5 shoulders, breaking up your ZG set? Try Darkmantle in some slots. You'll want to use a rogue DPS spreadsheet to try different combinations as you get new gear. You can find such spreadsheets on the [WoW Classic Rogue Discord](https://discord.gg/FD29PN2).

Getting Darkmantle takes you down a fun quest line. You'll run around the world. And enter old dungeons, but summon all new bosses. It provides a challenge and something to work on while we wait for the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj to open.

Once done with the quests you'll not only have your new armor. You'll also have the means to summon new bosses, with new loot, in old dungeons. Making you more in demand for dungeon groups.

All the above may be moot if getting the Darkmantle armor is going to be outside your time, resources, or interest.
