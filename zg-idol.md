# ZG Idol Runs

To help our members get BiS enchants for new head and leg items through Phase 5 and 6 we will be starting up ZG idol runs. These will be more limited and restrictive runs into ZG than what we’ve done before. They are not intended to replace regular ZG runs. Though the participants of the idol runs will be locked out from a full clear of ZG during the same reset period.

## Idol Run Basics

We will only hit four bosses in ZG.

1. From the entrance turn left and cross the water.
2. Kill [Jin’do the Hexxer](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11380/jindo-the-hexxer) for idol.
3. Kill [High Priestess Arlokk](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=14515/high-priestess-arlokk) for an 18-slot bag.
4. Kill [High Priest Thekal](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=14509/high-priest-thekal) for tiger mount.
5. Kill [Bloodlord Mandokir](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11382/bloodlord-mandokir) for idol and raptor mount.
6. Turn in idols for enchants.
7. Portal/hearth.

## Idol Loot Rules

The goal is to get BiS enchants for raid mains. To that end the idols will be limited to such and prioritized toward those who can use them the soonest and best.

*   Raid mains only, period.
*   Prioritized to those who have Tier 2, BWL, or Phase 5 gear to use it on at the start of the run. Further prioritized to those who have their voodoo dolls ready.
    *   “Who has gear to enchant right now and a voodoo doll?”
    *   Those people roll, top 2 take idols.
*   If no one has gear to enchant and/or their voodoo doll then all raid mains will roll to use the idol for future use.

The following class/specs will NOT be allowed to loot idols from these runs:

*   Feral cat druids
*   DPS priests
*   DPS paladins
*   DPS warriors

You must get your own voodoo doll. We will not be checking piles during these runs.

Your spec is what you sign up and raid as in progressive, 40-man content. Not the roll you are filling in the ZG run.

## All Other Loot Rules

Alts may take part, though raid mains with priority on the idol will get priority on invites. Both alts and raid mains may roll on all other loot.

*   Coins & Bijous - All greed
*   Bag & Mounts - All need (bag is unique)
*   All other boss loot - Need if you’ll use it, otherwise greed

These runs are only possible if we have regular participation by enough people. The runs will be shorter than many dungeons. If you want an idol soon please help others out as often as possible. If you’ve gotten your idol remember your raid companions still waiting. These enchants help us all in progression raiding.
