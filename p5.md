# Phase 5 Quick Start Guide

Phase 5 is best known for the Ahn’Qiraj raids. But it’ll also bring about a number of dungeon loot changes, new grinds for epics, free bag space, and more.

This guide is to help you learn about the new and updated content, what they offer, and what will be involved. As well as how the guild will handle certain content and loot.

*****

## Gates of Ahn’Qiraj Event & Scarab Lord Mount

Before AQ20, AQ40, or Sithilus Field Duty become available the gates of AQ must be opened through a server wide event. This is done in two parts: gathering war supplies and completing the Scepter of the Shifting Sands.

**Gathering War Supplies**

Both Alliance and Horde need to turn in materials. Turn ins grant you [Commendation Signets](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21436/alliance-commendation-signet). Which can be turned in for capital city reputation (do 10 at a time, better return) or supply boxes which contain green items and scrolls.

In vanilla this took months on some servers, especially with a faction imbalance like we have on Pagle. But in Classic the details are known in advance and the larger guilds have been coordinating to speed up this event. If you wish to participate have materials ready in advance and turn in ASAP after release.

Alliance war supplies:

*   90,000 x Copper Bar (1 Signet)
*   28,000 x Iron Bar (5 Signets)
*   24,000 x Thorium Bar (10 Signets)
*   33,000 x Stranglekelp (3 Signets)
*   26,000 x Purple Lotus (7 Signets)
*   20,000 x Arthas' Tears (10 Signets)
*   180,000 x Light Leather (1 Signet)
*   110,000 x Medium Leather (3 Signets)
*   80,000 x Thick Leather (7 Signets)
*   800,000 x Linen Bandage (1 Signet)
*   600,000 x Silk Bandage (5 Signets)
*   400,000 x Runecloth Bandage (10 Signets)
*   14,000 x Rainbow Fin Albacore (3 Signets)
*   20,000 x Roast Raptor (5 Signets)
*   17,000 x Spotted Yellowtail (7 Signets)

You’ll need a full stack of any item to turn in. You get 10 signets for the first turn in of any item. Repeat turn ins get the amount listed above.

_The war supplies event is NOT on the PTR. But the Scepter of the Shifting Sands quest line is. It is possible Blizzard will change up the materials required for the war supplies. Many players have requested as much, in order to relive the event more as it was in vanilla. If they do change materials it will significantly increase the time for the gates to be opened._

**Scepter of the Shifting Sands**

At the same time as the war supplies are gathered [an epic quest chain for the Scepter of the Shifting Sands](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/scepter-of-the-shifting-sands-scarab-lord-legendary-mount) begins. It rewards a number of epics and the [Black Qiraji Resonating Crystal](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21176/black-qiraji-resonating-crystal).

Assuming no changes from Blizzard it’ll take at least a week from Phase 5 launch for the event to be completed. Given it takes 5 days to move the war supplies above. The quest chain requires Blackwing Lair boss kills. On two different resets of the instance.

The first person on the server to complete the chain can ring the gong and open the gates to AQ. Any other person who completes the quest chain within 10 hours can receive the mount.

There is coordination among the larger raid guilds on Pagle for this event. They have war supplies gathered and their champion(s) selected. Yet, it is possible Blizzard will change the war supply requirements in some manner. To honor the vanilla experience of this world event. In that case the event will take longer. Giving more people a chance at completing the quest line.

Onyxia’s Bakery will be making a play to have a Scarab Lord. Those who had expressed interest and had the mats prepared selected Havel. This selection was also approved by the officers. Much of the effort will depend on the guild assisting. From rep grinding to unique raid level encounters in the open world. There will be no requirements placed on guild members. But participating will offer unique game experiences we’ll never see again.

Anyone can go through the Scepter of the Shifting Sands quest line after the initial event. All the quest rewards will be available, except for the scarab mount and future Scarab Lord title.

## Silithus Field Duty

Silithus Field Duty are repeatable quests to earn badges, which you turn in for gear or rep. Many of the quests are elite and will require a partner or group. Others will require a significant amount of gold or time to farm materials. The two notable rewards are [Rockfury Bracers](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21186/rockfury-bracers) and [Earthstrike](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21180/earthstrike).

_Field Duty quest won’t be available until the Gates of Ahn-Qiraj event is completed._

2. Pick up the Field Duty quest and right click on the Unsigned Field Duty Papers.
3. Go to Captain Blackanvil, in the Alliance camp outside of Cenarion Hold.
4. Help defeat the elite bug that attacks the camp. Captain Blackanvil must stay alive (maybe, was changed in 1.12 to where he respawns).
5. Get your papers signed, then return to Windcaller Kaldon.
6. Choose between a Combat, Logistics, or Tactical assignment. These reward a corresponding badge. And in some cases a follow up assignment.

You will need to repeat Field Duty each time you want a new assignment. You can have as many unique assignments as you have quest log and bag space for. You can save duplicates by keeping them in their container.

**Combat Assignments**

*   Kill 30 of some variant of Silithid bug.
*   These may be issued in dossier form, where you get four assignments for the same hive.
*   The bugs are all elite, so best to do this with a partner or group.

**Logistics Assignments**

*   Collect the listed items to turn in. Most are crafted from professions and should be available on the AH.

**Tactical Assignments**

*   Kill a specific summoned templar (1 in 4 random unless you have a Crest of Beckoning), a group of Twilight cultists, or scout deep inside a hive.

    *   Skin of Shadow

    *   Twilight Cultist Robe

**Mark of Cenarius**

        *   Signet of Beckoning: Water 

_The Signets of Beckoning are not required. But without them you’ll get a random Duke._

**Cenarion Circle Rep**

*   Get up to Friendly by completing quests from Cenarion Hold.
*   After that the most efficient rep grind is running AQ20, earning ~2000 per full clear.
*   Completing Field Duty quests will also earn rep.

## Dungeon Set 2

Dungeon Set 2 (Tier 0.5) are a direct upgrade to the original class based dungeon armor sets.

Druid - [Feralheart Raiment](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=513/feralheart-raiment)

Hunter - [Beastmaster Armor](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=515/beastmaster-armor)

Mage - [Sorcerer's Regalia](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=517/sorcerers-regalia)

Paladin - [Soulforge Armor](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=516/soulforge-armor)

Priest - [Vestments of the Virtuous](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=514/vestments-of-the-virtuous)

Rogue - [Darkmantle Armor](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=512/darkmantle-armor)

Warlock - [Deathmist Raiment](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=518/deathmist-raiment)

Warrior - [Battlegear of Heroism](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=511/battlegear-of-heroism)

Acquiring the upgrades involves a long quest series. Requiring time, skill, and gold. More so than many believe is worthwhile. The most viable set for raiders is the rogue’s. But it depends on one’s setup. And the sim data isn’t 100% reliable.

Do your homework before committing time and resources into the new armor. Or, you know, cause you like how they look.

**Tier 0.5 Quest Line Walkthrough**

[Wowhead Guide](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/dungeon-set-2-quest-walkthrough-classic-wow#dungeon-2-tier-0-5)

More expensive required materials include:

*   Delicate Arcanite Converter
*   Cured Rugged Hide (4)
*   Flask of Supreme Power
*   Mooncloth (3)
*   220 gold

You’ll also need the complete original dungeon set to finish the quest line.

**Summonable Bosses**

As a part of the quest series you will summon new bosses in all the high level dungeons. These bosses have their own loot table, with all new items (not currently in Wowhead). They can be summoned as part of a specific quest. Or by someone who has completed the quest line.

*****

## Dungeon Loot Revamp

In vanilla patch 1.10 Blizzard revamped many loot tables in the high level dungeons. New loot was added, including the all new relic slot items. And some old loot was moved around.

**All New Dungeon Loot**

*   [Blackrock Depths](https://classic.wowhead.com/rare-armor?filter=238:105;3:1584;5:0)
*   [Blackrock Spire (Lower & Upper)](https://classic.wowhead.com/rare-armor?filter=238:105;3:1583;5:0)
*   Scholomance - [Don Mauricio's Band of Domination](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22433/don-mauricios-band-of-domination)
*   [Stratholme (Live & Undead)](https://classic.wowhead.com/rare-armor?filter=238:105;3:2017;5:0)

**New Relics**

Relics replaced the range slot for classes who cannot use range weapons.

*   Druids get [Idols ](https://classic.wowhead.com/armor/type:8?filter=238:128;3:4;5:0)for healing or melee damage
*   Paladins get [Librams ](https://classic.wowhead.com/armor/type:7?filter=238:128;3:4;5:0)for tanking or mana use reduction

Some of the new relics are dropped by summoned Dungeon Set 2 bosses. Epic relics will be from AQ40.

**Old Loot Shuffle**

Some existing loot in Blackrock Depths will move to a different boss in Phase 5. Most notable [Hand of Justice](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11815/hand-of-justice) will move from Angerforge to the Emperor. But before you panic, know that the drop rate also goes up to 20% on the Emperor. So longer runs, but likely fewer of them.

[Savage Gladiator Chain](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11726/savage-gladiator-chain) and other epics will have increased drop rates. Though Gorosh the Dervish will still have a 1 in 6 chance of spawning.

**[Wowhead’s table on pre and post-patch 1.10 loot locations](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=295091/blackrock-depths-loot-tables-use-pre-1-10-sources-in-classic-wow)**

*****

## Professions

Many new recipes are introduced in Phase 5. Even if you don’t use professions there are new consumables, enchants, and bags which will be of interest.

**New Enchants**

*   [Enchant 2H Weapon - Agility](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=27837/enchant-2h-weapon-agility) (Friendly with Timbermaw Hold)
*   [Enchant Cloak - Dodge](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25086/enchant-cloak-dodge) (AQ40 drop)

*   [Enchant Cloak - Greater Nature Resistance](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25082/enchant-cloak-greater-nature-resistance) (Honored with Cenarion Circle)
*   [Enchant Cloak - Stealth](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25083/enchant-cloak-stealth) (AQ20 and AQ40 drop)
*   [Enchant Cloak - Subtlety](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25084/enchant-cloak-subtlety) (AQ40 drop)
*   [Enchant Gloves - Fire Power](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25078/enchant-gloves-fire-power) (AQ40 drop)
*   [Enchant Gloves - Frost Power](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25074/enchant-gloves-frost-power) (AQ20 and AQ40 drop)

*   [Enchant Gloves - Shadow Power](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25073/enchant-gloves-shadow-power) (AQ40 drop)
*   [Enchant Gloves - Superior Agility](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25080/enchant-gloves-superior-agility) (AQ20 and AQ40 drop)
*   [Enchant Gloves - Threat](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25072/enchant-gloves-threat) (AQ40 drop)

**Nexus Crystals**

[Nexus Crystals](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20725/nexus-crystal) also arrive with Phase 5. They are used for all the new glove and cloak enchants and will initially be in high demand. In Phase 6 they will also be required for Naxx related items.

Nexus Crystals come from disenchanting blue or epic items level 51 or higher:

*   Item level 66-99 blue items: 1x (0.5%)
*   Item level 56-60 epic armor: 1x (100%)
*   Item level 61-80 epic armor: 1x (50%), 2x (50%)
*   Item level 76-80 epic weapons: 1x (33%), 2x (67%)

_Guild enchanters have been storing unwanted epics from raids. To later turn into Nexus Crystals. Nexus Crystals will go toward Enchant Cloak - Greater Nature Resistance. AQ40 raiders will be provided with the enchant during their first AQ40 raid. Once completed other uses for Nexus Crystals will be considered._

**All Phase 5 Recipes**

[Wowhead Link](https://classic.wowhead.com/recipe-items/type:6:4:5:8:3:7:9:1:12:2?filter=238;3;5#items:0+14+19)

_Note the Gaea's Embrace, Sylvan, Bramblewood, and Ironvine listings are wrong._

*   [Elixir of Greater Firepower](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21546/elixir-of-greater-firepower) for newly respecced fire mages
*   [Transmute Elemental Fire](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25146/transmute-elemental-fire) will bring down Elemental Fire prices
