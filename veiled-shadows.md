# Veiled Shadows Set

AQ20 offers each class a 3-piece set. These come from quest items which drop from bosses. Each one requires Cenarion Circle reputation to turn in for their reward. As well as various scarabs and idols found from AQ20. For rogues it is the [Emblems of Veiled Shadows](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=498/emblems-of-veiled-shadows). A dagger, cloak, and ring. Wearing all three gives you a powerful set bonus: -10 energy cost for Slice and Dice.

## How Good Is Veiled Shadows?

Because of the set bonus these three pieces can be BiS for some rogues. At least until you get gear from AQ40 to fill in those same slots.

*   All dagger rogues
*   Non-human sword rogues w/o Maladath

The [numbers going around the rogue community](http://classicroguecraft.com/p5-bis-list-aq-prio/) are an 11 DPS increase for dagger rogues. And a 5-6 DPS increase for specific sword rogues. But those numbers are under more optimal conditions than we experience. They include Phase 4 BiS gear, full consumables, full world buffs, optmizied raid groups, and 90 second boss kills. So I ran my own numbers under conditions we usually play under.

*   Bitt Model (daggers): 8-9 DPS increase
*   Non-human Sword Model (epic swords, BF 8/8): 9-11 DPS increase

Still a good DPS increase for those rogues.

The dagger is a small upgrade from Core Hound Tooth or Dragonfang Blade in your OH. The cloak is a small upgrade for all our rogues. The ring isn't worth wearing in most cases until you've completed the set.
