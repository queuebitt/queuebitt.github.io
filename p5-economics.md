# Phase 5 Economics

As with each new phase of WoW Classic new items come on the market. But old items also change in their value. Some becoming obsolete. While others find an all new demand with the introduction of new content.

These are my predictions based on both the new content coming with Phase 5. And how other players have handled new content and item demand from previous phases. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Different types of investments involve different levels of risk. Consult your personal goblin financial advisor.

## Items Going Down In Value

These are items I plan to sell off before Phase 5 launch. I'm expecting a significant crash in these markets.

**Elemental Fire & Greater Fire Protection Potions** - Alchemists can make Elemental Fire cheaply. Fire pots will be in less demand as fewer people run MC and Ony.

**Wintersbite & Frost Power Elixir** - As mages go fire spec less demand for Frost Power boosts.

## Items Going Up In Value

Some of the value increase has already begun. All value gains may be fully realized before Phase 5 launches. Raiders should consider stocking up on nature protection pots in advance. As well as shards and essences for Phase 5 gear enchants.

**Firebloom & Firefin Snapper** - Used for Elixir of Greater Firepower, in demand by all the new fire mages.

**Heart of Fire** - Used to cheaply create Elemental Fire.

**Elemental Earth** - Used for Greater Nature Protection Potions. Demand for Elemental Sharpening Stones will also go up for a time until AQ40 is on farm for most guilds.

**Liferoot & Stranglekelp** - Used for Nature Protection Potion. Offers better damage absorption than regular fire or shadow pots. Given current prices it'll be a much better value for many raiders.

**Arcanite Bar** - Several new blacksmithing plans call for Arcanite Bars for new epic armor and weapons. Also, some alchemist will be transmuting these less.

**Essence of Air, Fire, Nature, Water, and Undeath** - Used for new cloak and glove enchants.

**Firebloom & Purple Lotus** - Used for new Brilliant Mana and Wizard Oils.

**Large Brilliant Shards** - Used by many new recipes. And fewer shards will be produced. As epics will disenchant into Nexus Crystals instead.

## Continued Inflation

Overall prices will continue to go up for a lot of items, at least through the start of Phase 5. Anything on the [war effort list](https://www.wowhead.com/news=279923/wow-classic-spotlight-the-ahnqiraj-war-effort#gathering-war-supplies) (assuming #nochanges). As well as anything used by raiders. Like we saw with Blackwing Lair there’ll be a spike in consumables for AQ40. I would expect the spike to last longer than before. But it depends on how long it takes the non-hardcore guilds to get it on farm. A month or two in we may see some prices come back down, though they’ll be higher than the average thus far. Then again Naxx prep will begin in earnest during Phase 5, causing all new price increases.

If you have significant gold savings it is worth considering putting it into investments. Doing so will help it hold its value. Gold inflation has been with us for a while, with no signs of it going away. Bots were only responsible for so much of the general inflation. By investing in items which go up in value at a similar rate you maintain your same purchasing power. Though all investments do carry some risk.

Invest in what you'll eventually need.  In almost every case these items will be cheaper today than they will be tomorrow.

*   Consumables
*   Enchanting mats
*   Frost resistance gear mats
*   Tier 3 armor turn in mats

The more adventuresome may want to look into long term investments. It is mostly too late to invest into Phase 5. But there is still time to invest into items which will be in higher demand in Phase 6.

*   Do your homework
*   Set a budget
*   Create enough long term storage
*   Diversify your investments

Those who don't like the idea of investing can continue to save their gold for new gold sinks coming with TBC (assuming current characters go through). Gold inflation will not affect the price of in game items.

*   Flying mounts cost 900 gold
*   Epic flying mounts cost an additional 5200 gold (6000 gold total if you go straight to epic)
*   22 slot bags for 1200 gold
*   Guild Banks, with tabs costing between 100 to 5000 gold each (9350 gold total)
