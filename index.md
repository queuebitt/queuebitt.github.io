# Bitt's WoW Classic Guides

Collection of guides on WoW Classic raiding. Created for my guild, but open to anyone.

## Phase 5 Guides

**Phase 5 Quick Start Guide**

https://queuebitt.github.io/p5

Get up to speed on all the new content coming in Phase 5. New raids, profession recipes, dungeon loot, and class/faction quests. Includes details on AQ40 and AQ20 loot and how it will be distributed.

**Nature Resistance Gear for AQ40 - https://queuebitt.github.io/nature-resist**

Onyxia Bakery's nature resistance gear requirements for AQ40. Includes easy to acquire gear suggestions. And links to find the best nature resistance gear for min/maxing.

**[Shadow Resistance Gear for AQ40](https://queuebitt.github.io/shadow-resist)**

Guide to gearing up our warlocks with shadow resistance for the Twin Emperors fight.

**[Phase 5 Economics](https://queuebitt.github.io/p5-economics)**

My predictions on upcoming price changes as Phase 5 approaches. See what items you should consider holding or selling.

**[Imp Expose Armor + Shout Spam](https://queuebitt.github.io/expose-armor)**

Info on a new raid meta which will take off in Phase 5. Replacing Sunder Armor with Imp Expose Armor in raids for a 5% increase in all physical damage.

**[ZG Idol Runs](https://queuebitt.github.io/zg-idol.md)**

Quick run down and loot rules on shortened ZG runs planned to get BiS head and leg enchants to our raid mains.

## Phase 6 Guides

Coming soon. Let's get through the start of Phase 5 first. But if you have questions feel free to ask Bitt directly in Discord or in game.

**Prepping for Naxx**

Naxxramas will involve the single most expensive raid prep in all of Classic. Or any future WoW raid, for that matter. Learn what you will need to get attuned, put together a frost resistance set, and to turn in your Tier 3 armor tokens. Get started now to save on coming price hikes.

**Frost Resistance Gear for Naxx**

Goes over Onyxia Bakery's frost resistance gear requirements for each class in more detail.

**Tier 3 Armor from Naxx**

Goes over Tier 3 armor sets and turn in requirements for each class in more detail.

## Rogue Guides

**[Rogue Dankmantle Armor](https://queuebitt.github.io/darkmantle)**

Details on the Darkmantle set for rogues coming in Phase 5. Potentially a better BiS set than Blackwing Lair gear. But with some hefty requirements and consideration.

**[Rogue Veiled Shadows Set](https://queuebitt.github.io/veiled-shadows)**

AQ20 offers a 3-piece set for each class. The Veiled Shadows has an awesome set bonus, making it an upgrade for many Blackwing Lair decked out rogues.
