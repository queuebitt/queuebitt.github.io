# Bitt's WoW Classic Guides

Collection of guides on WoW Classic raiding. Created for my guild, but open to anyone.

## Phase 5 Guides

**[Nature Resistance Gear for AQ40](https://queuebitt.github.io/nature-resist)**

Onyxia Bakery's nature resistance gear requirements for AQ40. Includes easy to acquire gear suggestions. And links to find the best nature resistance gear for min/maxing.

**Phase 5 Quick Start Guide**

Get up to speed on all the new content coming in Phase 5. New raids, profession recipes, dungeon loot, and class/faction quests. Includes details on AQ40 and AQ20 loot and how it will be distributed.

**Phase 5 Economics**

My predictions on upcoming price changes as Phase 5 approaches. See what items you should consider holding or selling.

**[Rogue Dankmantle Armor](https://queuebitt.github.io/darkmantle)**

Details on the Darkmantle set for rogue coming in Phase 5. Potentially a better BiS set than Blackwing Lair gear. But with some hefty requirements and consideration.

**[Rogue Veiled Shadows Set from AQ20](https://queuebitt.github.io/veiled-shadows)**

AQ20 offers a 3-piece set for each class. The Veiled Shadows set has an awesome set bonus, making it an upgrade for many Blackwing Lair decked out rogues.
