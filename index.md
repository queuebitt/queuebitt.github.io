## Rogue Guides

**[Dankmantle Armor](https://queuebitt.github.io/darkmantle)**

**[Veiled Shadows Set](https://queuebitt.github.io/veiled-shadows)**

AQ20 offers a 3-piece set for each class. The Veiled Shadows has an awesome set bonus, making it an upgrade for many Blackwing Lair decked out rogues.
