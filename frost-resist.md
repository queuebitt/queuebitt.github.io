# Frost Resistance Gear for Naxx

Frost resistance gear is for the [Sapphiron](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=15989/sapphiron) fight in Naxxramas. Sapphiron gives off a Frost Aura, a DoT to everyone within 100 yards. As well as a number of other frost AoE abilities inflicting damage. Making it a healing intensive fight.

Everyone in the raid will need to use resistance gear.

**Casters & Healers - 200 FR Minimum**

**Rogues & Feral Druids - 200 FR Minimum**

**Hunters - 200 FR Minimum**

**Warriors & Paladins - 200 FR Minimum**

You will be required to have your frost resistance gear mats ready in order to participate in Naxx raids. Most of the actual gear comes from quests and recipes located inside Naxx. So no one will have their minimum frost resistance on launch day.

To assist below are suggested sets for all classes/roles. Again, the items come from quests or crafting released with Naxx. But most of the materials can be gathered now. And given their current and expected future cost everyone should start gathering what they need ASAP. A list of materials for each group is included.

Resources for finding additional frost resist gear currently in the game are also provided below. This is useful for those wishing to min/max their set. Collecting more than the minimum is recommended. As the fight goes to farm status we may reduce the resistance minimum.

Guide Notes:

*   Phase 6 and Naxxramas are expected to be released mid January 2021.
*   Frozen Runes are found inside Naxxramas. They will be collected and distributed by the guild.
*   Glacial Cloaks with an enchant will be provided to all Naxx raiders by the guild. If you have the means to get mats for your own that's helpful, but not required.

## Additional Frost Resistance Gear

The sets above are recommended based on ease of collecting. They are provided through Naxx related quests and crafting. Most of their materials can be gathered now. But there are additional pieces of frost resistance gear which you may want to consider.

**[Naxx Drops](https://classic.wowhead.com/armor/side:1?filter=28:214;2:3456;1:0#0+9-13+20) - Awarded based on EP w/o GP cost. Prioritized for appropriate class/role. Lifetime limit of one per person.**

These items drop from Naxx bosses and are part of the epic frost resistance sets. They may provide better resistance and performance combinations, depending on your gear. But no one should count on having them.

**“Ice Guard Your Hat” - Havel, probably**

You can apply [Ice Guard](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=9211/the-ice-guard) to your Tier 2 head piece for an additional 10 frost resistance.

**All Frost Resistance Gear**

These links will show you nearly all frost resistance gear currently in the game (Phase 4). It does not include random greens with “of Frost Resistance” attributes.
