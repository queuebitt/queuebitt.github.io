# Tier 3 Armor from Naxx

Each class has a Tier 3 armor set available from Naxxramas. They are token base, but each piece also requires the completition of a quest. Which asks for a significant amount of crafting materials. The total value of which for a full set is high.

This guide will help you identify and start saving up for your own Tier 3 armor turn ins. Waiting until Phase 6 will likely see an increase in total cost. Starting now allows you to leverage relevant professions. Farm/earn the necessary gold. And buy materials at lower prices.

Guide Notes:

*   Phase 6 and Naxxramas are expected to be released mid January 2021.
*   Set pieces require various "wartorn" items, which drop from trash in Naxx. These will be collected and distributed by the guild.
*   You may not want all eight pieces, depending on your BiS and set bonus. Kel'Thuzad drops class rings which are the 9th piece of everyone’s Tier 3 armor. It counts toward your set bonus. Adjust your personal shopping list to match.
*   We don’t know how much time we’ll have in Naxx. In vanilla TBC released 6 months later. There may not be enough time for everyone to get their full set.
*   Naxx gear lasted for many levels during the early part of TBC.

## Gathering Materials

**Use Your Professions**

The best method to gather needed materials is with relevant professions. No one character can have all the professions their class set requires. So cooperation within the guild will make things easier for everyone.

If you can produce Mooncloth, Cured Rugged Hide, or Arcanite Bars you should do so. Save what you need and consider using the rest to trade for the other materials you need.

Miners can farm Arcane Crystals and make trades with druids, mages, priests, and warlocks. Or an alchemist crafting Arcanite Bars.

**Nexus Crystals**

Nexus Crystals are not easily farmed. They will be available in Phase 5. Disenchanting a level 51+ blue or epic item has a chance of producing 1-2, depending on the item and level. Unwanted raid epics will be turned into Nexus Crystals and kept by the guild bank for guild use. But we don't know how that supply will fair with Phase 5 demands.

Expect to purchase the Nexus Crystals you need from the AH.

**Buy With Gold**

Everything above is for sale on the AH. With enough gold you can buy what you need without professions.

If you need help making gold ask for help. Several of your guildmates have experience with making gold. Through a variety of means. You don't need a level 60 mage to make a profit.

You can also run Scholomance. It is the most profitable 5-man dungeon for your time. Good gold from mobs, trash and cloth drops, and Dark Runes sell well. Run with guildmates and put Dark Runes on round robin (all need first drop, winners pass on future drops until everyone has one, then repeat). It also gives you Argent Dawn rep, which will help lower your cost for Naxx attunement.

As a general rule prices will be lower today than they will be in the future. The demand for these items will be high come Phase 6. Farm and buy now.
