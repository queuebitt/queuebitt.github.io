# Rogue Notes for AQ40

Overall raid strategy is being handled by Ravelmin and Havel. And at the end of the day what they say goes. But here are some tips and tricks specifically for rogues going into AQ40.

## Talent Builds

New combat talent builds to consider for AQ40:

[Combat Swords](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#f0ecoxbZMhqbbVzxfo)

[Combat Daggers](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#f0gcoLZMIVbbEz0boV)

The Murder talent is useless in AQ40, as the bugs are classified as “other.” The above builds move those 2 points to get more DPS in AQ40. But you’ll lose even more DPS everywhere else, including Blackwing Lair and much of the open world.

Sword rogues gain 0.9% DPS in AQ40 moving points to Improved Poisons. But lose 1.9% DPS in other content.

Dagger rogues gain 0.2% DPS in AQ40 moving points to Ruthlessness. But lose 1.9% DPS in other content.

You can put everything into AQ40 progression and take the hit in easier content. Or keep the build you have now. Either is viable, just up to your personal priorities.

Regardless you should stay with combat spec for the start of Phase 5. [Seal Fate](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/rogue-dps-talents-builds-classic-wow#seal-fate-daggers-rogue-talent-build) isn’t viable until you have your Tier 2.5 armor. And really isn’t competitive unless you can keep world buffs for the whole raid.

## Viscidus

There are several strategies for this fight. Which one we settle on will be up to the raid leaders. Who are taking a “what works best for us” approach. But rogues (and other melee DPS) can give the raid more options with less than an hour of prep work.

With normal weapons melee DPS cannot assist with the freezing phase of Viscidus. In fact we’re a liability to healers and best help by staying out of the room. But with weapons which have a frost proc (not +frost damage) and Frost Oil we can assist with the freezing phase. And those same weapons work great in the shattering phase.

**Frost Melee Strategy**

Pre-raid

*   Get two [Coldrage Dagger](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10761/coldrage-dagger) from the last boss in Razorfen Downs. That includes sword rogues. And other melee DPS.
    *   [Fastest path to boss video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIrzrlRALyI). Rogues can stealth past everything.
    *   Focus the boss, ignore the adds. You shouldn’t need evasion.
    *   Dagger has an 18% drop rate, I got both of mine in 6 runs. Each run was less than 5 minutes once I had the path down.
*   Bring [Frost Oil](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3829/frost-oil) to apply to the daggers (full stack to start, only two once on farm).
*   No need to enchant the daggers, no enchant helps.

Phase 1 - Freeze

*   Damage doesn’t matter, number of frost hits matters.
*   Equip your Coldrage Daggers before the fight starts.
*   Attack using your lowest energy abilities. We’re looking for as many hits as possible to cause frost procs.
*   Open with 1 Sinister Strike, then hit SnD.
*   From there keep SnD up, use Feint on CD (can generate procs), and spam Sinister Strike.
*   Save Blade Flurry for the next phase.

Phase 2 - Shatter

*   Damage doesn’t matter, number of hits matters.
*   Keep the daggers equipped.
*   Open with 1 Sinister Strike, then hit SnD and Blade Flurry.
*   From there keep SnD up and spam Sinister Strike.
*   This phase only lasts 15 seconds, we need ~75 hits total.

Phase 3 - Globs

*   Now the fight is about damage.
*   Swap to your regular weapons and do your normal rotation.
*   If the boss isn’t dead we go back to Phase 1, so swap back to your frost daggers.

The downside to melee in the room for Phase 1 is there is nature damage going out at random. We could put more stress on healers than we’re worth. Wearing our nature resistance gear may be an option, though it hurts our DPS for Phase 3.

If we don’t include melee in Phase 1 the Coldrage Daggers are still useful. Melee has to do Phase 2, and our regular weapons are slower.

*   Epic Swords: 16 melee hits in 15 seconds w/SnD
*   Epic Daggers: 24 melee hits in 15 seconds w/SnD
*   Coldrage Daggers: 28 melee hits in 15 seconds

Alternatively dagger rogues can keep their weapons. And sword rogues can buy two [Poniard](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2208/poniard) from a vendor.

**Other Frost Proc Weapons**

Exact proc rates for these weapons in Classic is unknown. Any "best" lists I've seen are from private server testing, which is known to not match up with Classic. At the end of the day the Coldrage Daggers work fine and are the easiest for non-casters to get. Frost wands and mages are going to do most of the Phase 1 heavy lifting.

[Bonechill Hammer](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14487/bonechill-hammer) - Scholomance

[Hammer of Northern Wind](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=810/hammer-of-the-northern-wind) - World BoE, currently ~150 gold on AH

[Glacial Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19099/glacial-blade) - Horde only, available from vendor if Revered with AV

[Darrowspike](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13984/darrowspike) - Scholomance quest reward

[Hurricane](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2824/hurricane) - Ranged option for hunters. The original version used +frost damage and would not work for this fight. The Classic version uses seperate frost damage, so the thinking is it will work. But this has not been confirmed. Hunters can always go melee for less cost and guaranteed results.

[All Frost Wands](https://classic.wowhead.com/weapons/type:19?filter=35;4;0) - For priests and warlocks. Mana Channeling Wand from Dire Maul North is probably your easiest option.

Weapons with +frost damage attributes [will not work](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/weapons-with-frost-damage-or-any-other-school-dont-work/569190/7). The game applies them as regular damage, they do not count toward a Viscidus freeze

**Weapon Swap In Combat**

There are a few options for swapping weapons in combat. But there isn't a one best solution for everyone.

Macro - This is the easiest option. But only works if using two different weapons. If you use two of the same weapon it'll fail to equip the OH slot. As such this won't work for putting on two Coldrage Daggers.

    #showtooltip <item name>
    /equipslot 16 <MH weapon>
    /equipslot 17 <OH weapon>

Macro with Script - You can use a script to equip two of the same weapons. But they must be in designated bag slots for it to work.

    #showtooltip Coldrage Dagger
    /run local i,c=PickupInventoryItem,PickupContainerItem;i(16);if CursorHasItem()then c(4,4);end
    /run local i,c=PickupInventoryItem,PickupContainerItem;i(17);if CursorHasItem()then c(4,4);end

*Change the "4,4" in both lines with the bag coordinates you're using. First number is the bag ID (main backpack is 0, each slot to the right goes 1, 2, 3, 4). Second number is the slot ID (count left to right, like reading a paragraph).*

[ItemRack](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/itemrack-classic) - You can create a set for Coldrage Daggers and a set for your normal weapons. To swap in combat you must assign a keybinding to both sets. If you use a different gear swapping addon check it for how to swap weapons in combat.

Manually - Worst case you can open your bags and click on the weapons yourself. I suggest putting them in designated slots so you know exactly where they are. And where the swapped out weapons will go.

## Other Boss Fight Tips

**Skeram**

*   We may be called on to interrupt Arcane Explosion.
*   For interrupts always have 25+ energy saved up.
*   Use Mind-numbing Poison on both weapons to slow down casting.
*   If a mind controller player is nearby and not sheeped hit them with Blind.

**Battleguard Sartura**

*   We may be called on to stun targets, the stuns allow everyone else to DPS unharmed.
*   If stunning do a full 5 combo point Kidney Shot.
*   During whirlwind we can DPS with Evasion, good for building up stun combo points.

**Princess Huhuran**

*   This is the big nature resistance gear fight. Bring all you have to start, we may need more than 150.
*   Save your cooldowns until the boss is at 30%.

**Twin Emperors**

*   Lots of running around when bosses teleport. Boot speed enchant is nice here.
*   Only use 1-2 combo points on SnD. Longer SnD can get wasted when running.

**C'thun**

*   Being greedy to do DPS will wipe the raid. Situational awareness, position, and movement is much, much more important.
*   Save Evasion for when you’re in the stomach. If you are alone in the stomach then leave, you can’t solo the tentacles and survive.
