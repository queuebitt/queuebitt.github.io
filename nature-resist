# Nature Resistance Gear for AQ40

Nature resistance gear is for the [Princess Huhuran](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=15509/princess-huhuran) fight in AQ40. Huhuran hurls Poison Bolt at the closest 15 players when frenzied. It can occur throughout the fight, and goes off continuously once at 35% health.

Ideally only melee and hunters will need to use resistance gear. Except the two tanks, who remain in defensive gear. But all raiders are being asked to put together a set, just in case.

[Rogues & Feral Druids](#heading=h.9exbskeafm6k) - 150 NR Minimum**

**[Hunters](#bookmark=kix.nx7aet1na5vh) - 150 NR Minimum**

**[Warriors & Paladins](#bookmark=kix.ddhfpng88ryu) - 150 NR Minimum**

**[Additional Nature Resistance Gear](#bookmark=kix.vzcxkuk0cwax)**

You will be required to meet the above nature resistance minimum (without buffs) in order to participate in AQ40 raids.

To assist below are suggested sets for all classes/roles. Most items are relatively easy to get, requiring a bit of crafting, questing, and dungeon runs.

Resources for finding additional NR gear are also provided below. This is useful for those wishing to min/max their set. Collecting more than the minimum is also recommended. If the fight proves difficult we may need to raise the minimum to 200+ for melee and hunters. As the fight goes to farm status we may reduce the resistance minimum.

### **Additional Nature Resistance Gear**

The sets above are recommended based on ease of collecting. As well as being available now or at the release of Phase 5. But there are additional pieces of NR gear which you may want to consider.

**[AQ40 Drops](https://classic.wowhead.com/armor/side:1?filter=27:214;2:3428;1:0#0+15+20) - Awarded based on EP w/o GP cost. Prioritized for appropriate class/role. Limit one per person.**

These items drop from AQ40 bosses. They provide better resistance and DPS combinations. But no one should count on having them, given their low drop rate and high demand.

**Cenarion Circle Crafted Gear**

In patch 1.11 (release of Naxx, Phase 6 in Classic) nature resistance recipes were added to Cenarion Circle. Classic is following the same release order. Sandstalker set is available now. The cloak enchant will be available in Phase 5. The rest will not release until Phase 6 (confirmed not available on Phase 5 PTR).

**All Nature Resistance Gear**

These links will show you nearly all nature resistance gear currently in the game (Phase 4). The biggest exception being random greens with “of Nature Resistance” attributes.

Those interested in min/maxing their nature set should check out their options, but keep our nature resistance minimum (unbuffed) in mind. These would also be useful if we need to increase our resistance.
